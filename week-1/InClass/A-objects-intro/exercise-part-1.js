/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

let car = {
  brand: "Honda",
  model: "Jazz",
  color: "Grey",
  fuelType: "Petrol",
  seatingCapacity: 5,
  foldingSeats: true,
};

console.log(`The brand is ` + car["brand-of"]);
